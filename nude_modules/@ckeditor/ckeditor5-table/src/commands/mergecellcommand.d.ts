 * The merge cell command.
 *
 * The command is registered by {@link module:table/tableediting~TableEditing} as the `'mergeTableCellRight'`, `'mergeTableCellLeft'`,
 * `'mergeTableCellUp'` and `'mergeTableCellDown'` editor commands.
 *
 * To merge a table cell at the current selection with another cell, execute the command corresponding with the preferred direction.
 *
 * For example, to merge with a cell to the right:
 *
 * ```ts
 * editor.execute( 'mergeTableCellRight' );
 * ```
 *
 * **Note**: If a table cell has a different [`rowspan`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html50/tabular-data.html#attr-tdth-rowspan)
 * (for `'mergeTableCellRight'` and `'mergeTableCellLeft'`) or [`colspan`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html50/tabular-data.html#attr-tdth-colspan)
 * (for `'mergeTableCellUp'` and `'mergeTableCellDown'`), the command will be disabled.
